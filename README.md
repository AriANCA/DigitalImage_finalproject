# InSAR land subsidence mapping in Mexico City

# Introduction
The subsidence of Mexico City, due to groundwater extraction, began in the 1840s. Significant structural damage to urban infrastructure caused by compaction of overexploited aquifers is a well-known event in central Mexico.Due to the fact that the city is partially built over the area of an ancient lake (Lake Texcoco), it rests on heavily saturated clay that is collapsing due to over-extraction of groundwater.  In this study, subsidence is investigated and mapped with InSAR analysis using Sentinel-1A imagery, and the subsidence deformation patterns of the eastern part of Mexico City during the period from June to September 2022 are analyzed.

# Workflow
For this research, data of location and Sentinel-1 scenes were obtained by the Co-pernicus Open Access Hub. The advantage of the Sentinel-1A satellite is that it pro-vides C-band (5.6 cm wavelength) SAR data that are considerably enhanced in aspects of coverage, repeat cycle, etc. In addition, the Sentinel-1A satellite with a total swath width of 250 km (pixel size: 5 m Ã— 20 m) has the potential to map the global landmasses once every 12 days according to the acquisition plan of various sites [6]. The images used for InSAR analysis in this study were collected in 11 June 2022 and 27 September 2022. In addition, the images were obtained in the Interferometric Wide swath (IW) scanning mode with VV polarization and along the descending orbit of 143.
