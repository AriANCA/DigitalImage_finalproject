# InSAR land subsidence mapping in Mexico City

# Introduction
The subsidence of Mexico City, due to groundwater extraction, began in the 1840s. Significant structural damage to urban infrastructure caused by compaction of overexploited aquifers is a well-known event in central Mexico.Due to the fact that the city is partially built over the area of an ancient lake (Lake Texcoco), it rests on heavily saturated clay that is collapsing due to over-extraction of groundwater.  In this study, subsidence is investigated and mapped with InSAR analysis using Sentinel-1A imagery, and the subsidence deformation patterns of the eastern part of Mexico City during the period from June to September 2022 are analyzed.
